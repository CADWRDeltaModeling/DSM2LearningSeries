For reading/writing HEC-DSS files [https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-dss/]
HEC-DSS is an ancient database used by the Army Corps of Engineers and prevalent
in water related models. This module is a bridge to read and write time series
data from this data format and read it into pandas DataFrame

* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://cadwrdeltamodeling.github.io/pyhecdss/


Features
--------

* Open and close DSS files
* Read catalog of DSS files as pandas DataFrame
* Read and write time series from DSS files

Limitations
-----------

* Only support for Python 3 - 64 bit for windows and linux
* Relies on pre-compiled libraries the source distribution of which is not allowed

Credits

This package wraps the `HEC-DSS Software`_ using the `Swig`_ library.

This package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template.
